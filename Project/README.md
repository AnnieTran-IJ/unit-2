# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for Survival of a Stray Cat

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
Halley, a stray cat residing near a school, faces significant challenges as seasons change. For example, the harsh winter weather, characterized by extremely cold and dry conditions, poses serious risks to Halley’s well-being. These risks include respiratory issues like asthma and bronchitis, exacerbated by low humidity (1), as well as hypothermia and frostbite due to freezing temperatures, wind, and snow (2). Another example is the summer, characterized by extremely hot conditions which are also detrimental to Halley's health. Given the concerns of the students and teachers who wish to ensure Halley’s safety, the primary problem is determining if a suitable indoor space on campus can provide appropriate environmental conditions, particularly regarding humidity and temperature, to improve Halley’s chances of survival and comfort. _*See the evidence of consultation in the appendix_
## Proposed Solution
Considering the client's requirements an adequate solution includes a low-cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that processes and analyzes the samples acquired. For a low-cost sensing device, an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequate precision and range for the client's requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20, or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however, the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more elaborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision, and accuracy required in this application, the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often-used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"[^4]. In addition to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this device is programable and expandable[^1]. I considered alternatives such as different versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constraints of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature and platform independence contribute to the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies potential future enhancements or modifications, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for extensive redevelopment [^5][^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a high-level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is the responsibility of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition, an HLL language will allow me and future developers to extend the solution or solve issues promptly.

_TOK Connection: To what extent does ```the use of data science``` in climate research influence our understanding of environmental issues, and what knowledge questions arise regarding the ```reliability, interpretation, and ethical implications``` of data-driven approaches in addressing climate change?_

**1. How does our use of technology shape our understanding of the environment?**
  Technology uncovers patterns and trends, such as rising global temperatures and shifting weather patterns, that would be impossible to detect through observation alone. Predictive models, satellite imaging, and machine learning provide insights into the causes and impacts of climate change, guiding policy and action. This technological lens allows us to grasp the scale and complexity of environmental issues more clearly than ever before.
  
  However, the use of data science raises critical questions, such as "How do we account for biases in data collection and limitations in models that might skew findings?" "Are interpretations of data shaped by human or algorithmic assumptions, and how does this affect conclusions?" Ethical concerns occur when data is used selectively or disproportionately to influence policies, potentially marginalizing certain communities.

**2. What responsibilities do we have as technologists when it comes to handling personal data related to our living spaces?** 
  In the context of our project, we must ensure the privacy of individuals by anonymizing any collected data and being transparent about how it is used. Users should give informed consent for the monitoring process, knowing exactly what data is being collected and for what purpose. Security measures such as encryption and secure storage must be implemented to protect the data from unauthorized access. Additionally, we should adhere to data minimization, collecting only the environmental information necessary to improve living conditions without compromising personal privacy.

**3. What cultural and contextual factors might impact our interpretation of the results, especially when comparing our local readings with those from the campus?**
  One of the key factors is the perception of comfort, which can vary depending on cultural backgrounds; for example, individuals from warmer climates may tolerate higher temperatures and humidity better than those from cooler regions. Additionally, occupancy patterns in different parts of the campus, such as dormitories versus study buildings, can create variability in readings, as higher foot traffic or different uses of space may influence temperature and humidity levels.

  Contextual elements like building design and maintenance also play a role, as older buildings may have poorer insulation or ventilation, messing up the comparison with newer or better-maintained structures. The timing of the readings is another important factor; environmental conditions may differ between daytime and nighttime due to varying activities or heating schedules. Finally, expectations and biases among users can affect interpretation, as individuals may attribute discomfort to specific factors (e.g., blaming humidity over temperature) based on personal experiences or assumptions, even if the data suggests otherwise.

### Development:
**Data Collection:**
 
Cited from the file `combined_arduino.ino`:
 
To collect data according to the client's needs, we first set up a connection between two sensors and the Arduino board connected to a computer. This configuration makes it easier to monitor and manage the incoming data.

We designed the setup function as follows:
 
```.C++
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
```
Initially, we researched about the Serial module, which is an instance of the HardwareSerial class that is part of the Arduino core and allows us to establish the desired connection (1). The `begin()` function is then called with a baud rate of 9600 bits per second (bps). We investigated why this rate is chosen instead of a higher one (for instance, 115200 baud), and found that 9600 bps has been around for  millennials and proved to be sufficient for most basic applications, such as debugging and simple data transmissions, as implemented in this project (2). Subsequently, we configured the Serial Monitor to send messages confirming the progress of the setup process.
 
```.C++
    // Initialize BME280
    Serial.println(F("Initializing BME280..."));
    bool bmeStatus = bme.begin(0x76);
    if (!bmeStatus) {
        Serial.println("Could not find a valid BME280 sensor; check wiring!");
        while (1);
    }
    Serial.println("BME280 initialized successfully!");
 
    // Initialize DHT11
    Serial.println("Initializing DHT11...");
    dht.begin();
    Serial.println("DHT11 initialized successfully!");
}
```
Next, we attempt to start the BME280 sensor. By using `Serial.println(F("Initializing BME280..."))`, a message is printed to indicate that the initialization process has begun. The `bme.begin(0x76)` method is called on the bme object, which tries to communicate with the BME280 sensor using the I2C address 0x76, which is the default for this sensor (3). The return value, stored in the boolean variable `bmeStatus`, is checked to confirm if the sensor was successfully detected. If the sensor is not found, an error message is printed, and the program enters an infinite loop (`while (1);`), halting further execution. If the sensor is found, a success message is printed to the Serial Monitor, similarly for the DHT11 sensor.
```.C++
void loop() {
    // Read BME280 Data
    float bmeTemperature = bme.readTemperature();
    float bmePressure = bme.readPressure() / 100.0F;
    float bmeHumidity = bme.readHumidity();


    // Read DHT11 Data
    float dhtHumidity = dht.readHumidity();
    float dhtTemperature = dht.readTemperature();


    // Handle potential read errors
    if (isnan(dhtHumidity) || isnan(dhtTemperature)) {
        Serial.println("DHT11,ERROR");
    } else {
        Serial.print("DHT11,");
        Serial.print(dhtHumidity);
        Serial.print(",");
        Serial.print(dhtTemperature);
    }
    Serial.println();
    // Output BME280 Data
    Serial.print("BME280,");
    Serial.print(bmeTemperature);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(bmePressure);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(bmeHumidity);
    Serial.println();
    delay(60000)
```
After that, we want to continuously collect and process data from the sensor every minute. Hence, for the main function of the program, we created a loop that runs every 60000 milliseconds (= 1 minute) – `delay(60000)`. The methods `bme.readTemperature()`, `bme.readPressure()`, and `bme.readHumidity()` retrieve the temperature (in Celsius), pressure (in Pascals, later converted to hectopascals), and relative humidity, respectively. A similar process applies to DHT11. To ensure the flow of the program, we also added a validation part to check whether there are invalid values (i.e., NaN or "not a number").

After processing the DHT11 data, the program prints the BME280 data in the format BME280,<temperature>,<pressure>,<humidity> to the Serial Monitor. Each piece of data is separated by a comma, allowing for easy parsing in the next steps.

**Success Criteria Addressed: 2**
Next, to save the data according to the client's needs, we wrote a Python program to store all the collected sensor readings in a local CSV file. Additionally, we decided to send the data to a remote storage location on the ISAK-S network as a backup to safeguard against risks associated with saving data locally, such as file corruption, accidental deletion, or hardware failure.

Cited from the file `solution.py`:
```.C++
def process_data(line):
    dht_data = None
    bme_data = None
```
We designed this function to process every single line of sensor data received from the Arduino. In order to avoid, unorganized data and mismatched timestamps, we want all values of both sensors to be collected, validated, and available before saving into the CSV file; therefore, we created 2 variables for temporary storage (`dht_data` and `bme_data`). 

_*function process_data() continued:_
```.C++
   try:
       parts = line.strip().split(',')
       sensor_type = parts[0]


       #timestamp
       current_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.localtime())
```
Since there are 5 different values being extracted from the Arduino file, we imagine there would be a lot of possibilities of getting an error. Therefore, for better error management, we decided to use the try-except statement to catch and handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of code, preventing the program from crashing abruptly as continuous data is especially important for the essence of this project to have the most accurate portrait of the situation.

In the line `line.strip().split(',')` , the received line is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and separated into components based on commas. The first part of the line, `parts[0]`, identifies the sensor type ("DHT11" or "BME280"). Next, a timestamp is generated in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, representing the current time when the data is processed. This timestamp will later be stored alongside the sensor data in the CSV file.

_*function process_data() continued:_
```.C++
       # Process DHT11 data
       if sensor_type == "DHT11":
           dht_humidity = float(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else None
           dht_temp = float(parts[2]) if len(parts) > 2 else None
           dht_data = (dht_temp, dht_humidity)  #store the data temporarily
           print(f"DHT11 - Temperature: {dht_temp}, Humidity: {dht_humidity}")
       # Process BME280 data
       elif sensor_type == "BME280":
           bme_temp = float(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else None
           bme_pressure = float(parts[2]) if len(parts) > 2 else None
           bme_humidity = float(parts[3]) if len(parts) > 3 else None
           bme_data = (bme_temp, bme_pressure, bme_humidity)  #store the data temporarily
           print(f"BME280 - Temperature: {bme_temp}, Pressure: {bme_pressure}, Humidity: {bme_humidity}")
```
This part is designated for specific data from the DHT11 sensor. According to the format created initially, if existing, the second and third parts of the line will correspond to the DHT11 readings. Therefore, `float(parts[1])` converts the second part of the line to a float and stores it as `dht_humidity`; if it does not exist, it is set to None. Similarly, the third part (parts[2]) is assigned to `dht_temp`. These values are temporarily stored in the global variable `dht_data` as a tuple. Then, a message is printed to the console for debugging purposes. A similar process applies for BME280.
```.C++
       if dht_data and bme_data: #when both of them are collected, then save in the local file
           dht_temp, dht_humidity = dht_data
           bme_temp, bme_pressure, bme_humidity = bme_data
           save_to_csv(current_time, dht_temp, dht_humidity, bme_temp, bme_pressure, bme_humidity)
           print(f"Logged data: {current_time}, {dht_temp}, {dht_humidity}, {bme_temp}, {bme_pressure}, {bme_humidity}")


           dht_data = None
           bme_data = None
```
For this next part, the overview is that once data from both sensors is available, it combines the values and saves them to the CSV file. The 2nd and 3rd line is the function extracting the temporarily stored data. Then, it calls the `save_to_csv` function, passing the timestamp and sensor data. Afterward, it should print a message confirming that the data has been logged successfully and reset 2 `dht_data`` and `bme_data to None to prepare for the next data collection cycle.

**Success Criteria Addressed: 5**

### Code in Pycharm - Graphing
To provide a clear overview of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data from both local and remote servers, we created individual graphs representing each dataset. For a more effective analysis, we organized the data into three distinct sets:
Raw data combined with smoothed data
Data with a non-linear trend line and prediction based on it
Data analysis that includes annotations for the standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values.

#### 1. Raw data combined with smoothed data and cubic model

We wanted to plot many graphs, but we realized that the code gets really repetitive and becomes hard to debug and change. Hence, we decided to create another file called `graph_lib.py` apart from the two identical graphing files: `graphs_local.py` and `graphs_remote.py`. `graph_lib.py` has all the functions for graphing. 

There are 3 functions relevant to this success criteria:
moving_average()
plot_cub_model()
plot_data()

Moving average:
```
def moving_average(windowSize:int, x:list) -> list:
    x_smoothed = []
    for i in range(0,len(x)-windowSize):
        x_section = x[i:i+windowSize]
        x_average = sum(x_section)/windowSize
        x_smoothed.append(x_average)
    return x_smoothed
```
This function takes two parameters: windowSize (an integer) and x (a list). It starts with creating a new list for the smoothed x values. Then it goes into a for loop and repeats for length of list x minus windowSize. The process being repeated includes making a variable called x_section which is the value of x from i to i+windowSize. It then takes the average of all these values (sum of everything in the list divided by windowSize). Then, that value is appended to the list x_smoothed and when the loop finishes, is returned. 

We created this function because it’s crucial when we want to graph smoothed data. This is from an exercise we did in class. 

Plot_cub_model():
```
def plot_cub_model(value):
    x = [i for i in range(len(value))]
    coefficients = np.polyfit(x, value, 3)
    x_model = np.linspace(min(x), max(x), 500)
    y_model = np.polyval(coefficients, x_model)
    plt.plot(x_model, y_model,color="#9b495d")
    return "Cubic model plotted successfully"
```
In the plot_cub_model(), it takes in 1 parameter: value, which is a list. It starts with initializing x as i for every i in the range of the length of value. Coefficients is also initialised as a list of cubic coefficients using np.polyfit. X_model is then set to 500 points between the smallest x and the biggest x, and y_model is set as the evaluated values of the cubic coefficients using the function numpy.polyval(). Then we plot the x and y model with the color “#9b495d" and return “Cubic model plotted successfully)

This is crucial for plotting the cubic model trendline for the data. We checked the numpy documentation  (8) to find polyval() which evaluates a polynomial at specific values. We choose to use this because it makes it easier to debug since we only need to change 2 parameters. We also decided to use list comprehension to avoid our code looking very confusing and long since we have 200 lines of code and it’s really difficult to scroll through them and find a specific part. 

Plot_data():
```
def plot_data(subplot,x:list,y:list, ylabel,yunits):
    subplot.plot(x,y,color = "#c7d9e5")
    subplot.set_title(ylabel)
    subplot.set_xlabel("Time (hr)")
    subplot.set_ylabel(ylabel+yunits)
    x_l = []
    for t in range(len(x)):
        if (t)%360 == 0 and t+13<=len(x):
            x_l.append(x[t+13][11:-3])
    subplot.set_xticklabels(x_l)
    subplot.set_xticks(np.arange(13, len(x) + 1,360))
    return("data plotted successfully")
```
plot_data() takes in 5 parameters: subplot, x, y, ylabel, yunits. This function plots on subplot using the values passed into the function, anda also set the xticks label to recurring once every 6 hours. It returns “dataa plotted successfully’’ for debugging reasons. See fig 5 for more details on this function. 

Creating this function makes it easier for us as it decreases the length of the main graphing files and is easy to make changes to since all we need to change are the parameters. This is the most frequently used function in our graphing files. 


Cited from file `graphs_local.py`:
```
g1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])
xDT = data["time"]
yDT = data["temperature_DHT"]
yDT_smoothed = moving_average(ws,yDT)
print(plot_data(g1,xDT,yDT,"Temperature (DHT)"," (°C)"))
g1.plot(xDT[int(ws/2):len(yDT_smoothed)+int(ws/2)],yDT_smoothed,color="#577c8e")
print(plot_cub_model(yDT))
g1.legend(['raw data', 'smoothed data', 'cubic model'],loc = 'lower right', fontsize = 'x-small')
```
This part uses all the values as parameters and pass them into the functions we just mentioned to create graphs. This is also used for many other graphs, whether they are remote data or local data.

**Fig. 10** shows local temperature, humidity, and pressure measured by the DMT11 sensor on the left and BME280 on the right with raw and smoothed data and cubic model. 
#### Success Criteria Addressed: 1 & 3



#### 2. Data analysis that includes annotations for the minimum, maximum, and median values.

Cited from `graph_lib.py`:
```
def calc_statistics(values):
    stats = {
        "mean": np.mean(values),
        "min": np.min(values),
        "max": np.max(values),
        "median": np.median(values),
    }
    return stats
```
This function uses numpy to calculate the statistics values and return them as a dictionary with the corresponding keys. 

Cited from `graphs_local.py`:
```
tats_temp = calc_statistics(data["temperature"])

plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.7, wspace=0.1)

temp_stats = plt.subplot(3, 1, 1)
plot_data(temp_stats, data["time"], data["temperature"], "Temperature Statistics", " (°C)")
temp_stats.plot(data["time"][int(ws/2):len(yT_smoothed)+int(ws/2)],yT_smoothed,color="#577c8e")
temp_stats.axhline(stats_temp["median"], color='green', linestyle='--', label='median')
temp_stats.axhline(stats_temp["min"], color='purple', linestyle='--', label='min')
temp_stats.axhline(stats_temp["max"], color='orange', linestyle='--', label='max')
temp_stats.legend(['raw data', 'smoothed data','median', 'min','max'], loc='upper right', fontsize='x-small')
```
This uses the values and the functions in graph_lib.py to plot the dotted lines representing these values with different colors.

Fig.11 shows the median, minimum, and maximum values of the local temperature, humidity, and pressure data.


```
plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.7, wspace=0.1)
a1 = plt.subplot(3,1,1)
plot_data1(a1,data["time"],avg1,"Average Temperature"," (°C)")
a1.plot(data["time"][int(ws/2):len(a1_smoothed)+int(ws/2)],a1_smoothed,color="#577c8e")
a1.fill_between(data["time"], avg1 - stats_temp["std_dev"], avg1 + stats_temp["std_dev"], alpha=0.5, color="#91bcd9", label="Standard Deviation Region")
a1.legend(['raw data', 'smoothed data','error bars'],loc = 'lower right', fontsize = 'x-small')
```
This uses the standard deviation values and plot an area filled of the standard deviation as error bars using the fill_between() function from matplotlib.

Fig.12 shows the error bar of the local temperature, humidity, and pressure data.

#### Success Criteria Addressed: 4
#### 3. Graphs with prediction for the next 12 hours. 
Cited from `graphs_local.py`:
```
current_time = len(data["time"])
future_time = np.arange(current_time, current_time + 12 * 60)
x_data1 = np.arange(len(data["time"]))
y_data1 = avg1
coefficients1 = np.polyfit(x_data1, y_data1, 3)
predicted_values1 = cub(coefficients1[0], coefficients1[1], coefficients1[2], coefficients1[3], future_time)

plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.7, wspace=0.1)
a1 = plt.subplot(3,1,1)
plot_data(a1,data["time"],avg1,"Average Temperature"," (°C)")
a1.plot(data["time"][int(ws/2):len(a1_smoothed)+int(ws/2)],a1_smoothed,color="#577c8e")
xticks = np.concatenate([data["time"], future_time])
# a1.set_xticks(xticks[::360])
# a1.set_xticklabels(xticks[::360])
plot_cub_model(avg1)
plt.plot(future_time, predicted_values1, color="#bf8f90", linestyle='--')
a1.legend(['raw data', 'smoothed data',"cubic model", "predicted data (next 12 hours)"],loc = 'lower right', fontsize = 'x-small')
```
This starts by merging the current time and future 12 hours together as the x-axis, then using the cubic model to predict the values, and using those values to graph the predicted values for the future 12 hours.

Fig.13 shows the prediction of the next 12 hours of the local temperature, humidity, and pressure data.
